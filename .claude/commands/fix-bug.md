description: Debug and fix issues in the application
---

Help me debug and fix an issue in the Penumbra application.

Debugging approach:
1. Understand the problem - ask for details about the bug
2. Locate relevant code - search through the codebase
3. Analyze the issue - review logs, error messages, and code logic
4. Propose a fix - explain the solution before implementing
5. Test the fix - verify it resolves the issue without breaking other functionality

Common debugging areas:
- **Frontend issues:** Component rendering, state management, Material-UI components
- **Backend issues:** Server actions, API routes, database queries
- **Authentication:** Clerk integration, middleware, webhooks
- **Database:** Prisma queries, relations, migrations
- **External APIs:** ISBNdb API integration

Helpful commands:
- `npm run dev` - Run dev server with hot reload
- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Check terminal for server-side errors
- `npx prisma studio` - View database contents

Describe the bug you're experiencing, including error messages and steps to reproduce.

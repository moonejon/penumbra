description: Start the development server and monitor for issues
---

Start the Next.js development server for the Penumbra project:

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
2. The app will be available at http://localhost:3000
3. Monitor the output for any errors or warnings
4. Report any issues found

The project uses:
- Next.js 15 with Turbopack
- React 19
- TypeScript

If there are any startup errors, help me diagnose and fix them.

description: Build the project and fix any errors
---

Build the Penumbra Next.js application for production:

1. Run `npm run build` to create a production build
2. Monitor for TypeScript errors, linting issues, or build failures
3. If errors are found, analyze them and fix them systematically
4. Re-run the build to verify all issues are resolved

The build process includes:
- TypeScript compilation
- Next.js optimization and bundling
- Route generation

After fixing all errors, confirm that the build completes successfully.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Development Database Setup

### Syncing Production Data to Development

To populate your local development database with production book data:

```bash
# Preview what will be synced (recommended first)
npm run sync-prod-data -- --dry-run --user-id=1

# Sync production data to development
npm run sync-prod-data -- --user-id=1
```

This script will:
- Export all books from the production database
- Transform the owner IDs to match your development user
- Replace all books in your local database with production data

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for detailed documentation and all available options.
